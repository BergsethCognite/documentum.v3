    when the password was missing.
  * Fixed issue 28 to index metadata only if no content is available,
    or if the content is too large (larger than 30 MB). This also
    supports indexing folders.
  * Fixed issue 31 to use the can_index attribute of the dm_format
    object associated with a document to decide whether to index the
    content.
  * Fixed issue 42 to correctly index repeating ID attributes.
  * Fixed issue 43 to require Read permission during authorization.
    Previous versions only required Browse permission.
  * Fixed issue 44 to add support for Documentum 6.5.
  * Fixed issue 45 to accept Webtop URLs in more circumstances, such
    as authenticated web sites, self-signed certificates, certificates
    with an internal certificte authority, and certificates with a
    mismatching host name.
  * Fixed issue 47 to compile the code with debug information.
  * Fixed issue 48 to handle concurrent authentication requests. The
    authentication process was not thread-safe, and multiple

    document.

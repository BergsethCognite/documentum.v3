Welcome to the Google Enterprise Connector for EMC Documentum Content Server!

The Google Enterprise connector framework enables Google search
appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems.  
An enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

This EMC Documentum Content Server Connector provides access to
documents and document meta-data stored in the Documentum Content
Server developed by the EMC Corporation.

The EMC Documentum Content Server Connector communicates with the
Content Server using the Java language Documentum Foundation Classes
(DFC) library. To properly build this connector you will need access
to the set of DFC Java classes. DFC is a commercial product offered by
the EMC Corporation and is not included in this distribution.
